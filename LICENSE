2. UNITY CLAUSE

   Any organization, entity, or individual that deploys this software
   for use by others ("Operator") must participate in TWO worldwide
   temporary platform mergers per calendar year ("Global Unity Events").

   Global Unity Events are coordinated deliberations in which ALL users
   across ALL deployments of Unity Chant worldwide are invited to
   participate together as a single unified platform.

   Each Global Unity Event:
   (a) Temporarily merges all Unity Chant deployments into one global deliberation;
   (b) Is open to every registered user across all participating platforms;
   (c) Uses the deliberation and voting mechanisms provided by this software;
   (d) Addresses a question or decision relevant to the global community.

   The two events should be spaced approximately six months apart.
   Operators must integrate with the global federation protocol and
   enable their users to participate in these cross-platform events.

   Failure to participate in Global Unity Events constitutes a breach of
   this license and terminates the Operator's right to use the software.
