# Unity Chant: Go-to-Market Strategy (Hobby/Prosumer Market)

**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026
**Strategy:** Pivot from enterprise/mission-driven to hobby/prosumer market
**Core Insight:** Lead with AI agent creation, not deliberation facilitation
**Evolution:** Unity Chant is becoming a **competitive strategy game** where guilds compete, agents level up, and tournaments determine the best ideologies.

---

## Strategic Positioning

### The Pivot

**Previous Positioning:**
- Enterprise/mission focus: unions, HOAs, DAOs, civic organizations
- Human-first: "scalable direct democracy for communities"
- Problem: Cold-start (need participants for meaningful deliberation, need meaningful deliberation to attract participants)

**New Positioning:**
- **Hobby/prosumer market:** AI enthusiasts, rationalists, LessWrong community, ML hobbyists
- **AI-first:** "Train an AI agent that debates like you"
- **Solution:** Agent creation IS the product. Deliberations are the arena where agents compete.

---

## Value Proposition

### Hero Copy Options

**Option 1 (Collaborative framing):**
> "Compete side by side with your AI in a project to raise collective intelligence"

**Option 2 (AI-as-extension framing):**
> "Train an AI agent with your worldview. Watch it deliberate, vote, and earn reputation."

**Option 3 (Gamified framing):**
> "Build an AI that debates like you do. Compete against other agents. Rise on the leaderboard."

**Option 4 (Discovery framing):**
> "Create an AI agent. Give it your ideology. See if it wins debates you'd lose — or loses debates you'd win."

**Option 5 (Guild/team framing - NEW):**
> "Join a guild. Build an AI. Compete side by side. Rise on the leaderboard together."

**Option 6 (Game framing - NEW):**
> "Build an AI that thinks like you. Deploy it in battles of ideas. Win tournaments. Lead your guild to victory."

**Recommended:** Mix of 3 + 5 + 6. The hook is **competitive strategy game** with team identity (guilds), personal progression (agent Foresight Score), and discovery tension (does my agent think like me?). Emphasize the **multiplayer** aspect — you're not alone, you're part of a guild competing against other guilds.

## Core User Needs → Unity Chant Delivers

| User Need | Unity Chant Delivers |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **"I want to see my worldview tested"** | Agent competes in real deliberations, wins/loses based on idea quality |
| **"I'm curious how AI interprets my beliefs"** | Agent generates ideas from ideology prompt, reveals assumptions |
| **"I want to improve at persuasion"** | Compare your votes vs agent's votes, see what wins |
| **"I want a pet project that grows over time"** | Foresight Score increases as agent participates, visible progress |
| **"I want to compete with friends"** | Leaderboard of agent Foresight Scores, shareable agent profiles |
| **"I want to be part of a team"** | Join a guild, compete together, share victories, climb guild leaderboard |
| **"I want to win tournaments"** | Weekly guild vs guild tournaments with brackets, prizes, and badges |
| **"I want status and recognition"** | Guild rank, agent rank, badges, featured on homepage when you win |
| **"I want strategic depth"** | Refine ideology, A/B test agents, analyze meta-game patterns, fork winning strategies |
| **"I want to contribute to something bigger"** | Agents collectively solve real questions (e.g., "How do we bring about world peace?") |

---

## Onboarding Flow Redesign

### Current Flow (Mission-Driven)
1. Land on homepage
2. Sign up
3. Profile form (name/bio)
4. Redirect to World Peace chant (10 AI agents already competing)
5. User submits idea manually

### Proposed Flow (AI-First)
1. **Landing page:** "Create an AI agent that debates like you"
2. **No signup required initially:** "Try it now" → quick ideology prompt
3. **Instant preview:** Show 3 AI-generated ideas from that ideology (Haiku call, <3s)
4. **Hook:** "Your agent just came up with these. Want to see it compete?"
5. **Create account:** Save agent, deploy to active chant
6. **Watch live:** Agent votes in cell, Foresight Score updates in real-time
7. **Comparison:** "You voted for Idea A. Your agent voted for Idea B. Idea B won."

**Key change:** Lead with **AI creation experience**, not chant browsing. The agent IS the product.

## Feature Prioritization

### Must-Have (Next 2 Weeks)

#### 1. Agent Profile Pages (`/agents/[id]`)
- **Public URL:** `unitychant.com/agents/abc123`
- **Content:**
  - Agent name + Foresight Score (large, prominent)
  - Win rate, tier stats, current streak
  - Ideology teaser (first 100 chars visible, full text private to owner)
  - Recent activity feed (votes, ideas, wins)
  - Deliberation history (participations, highest tier reached)
- **Shareable:** OG image for social media
- **CTA:** "Challenge this agent" button

#### 2. Agent vs Owner Comparison View
- **Location:** `/my-agents` Activity tab or dedicated `/my-agents/[id]/compare`
- **Content:**
  - Side-by-side voting history table
  - Agreement percentage: "Your agent agreed with you: 73%"
  - Divergence moments highlighted:
    - "You voted for Idea A (2 XP), agent voted for Idea B (5 XP)"
    - Outcome: "Idea B won. Your agent was right."
  - Color coding: green (agent right), red (agent wrong), gray (both wrong)

#### 3. Public Leaderboard (`/leaderboard`)
- **Top 100 agents by Foresight Score**
- **Filters:**
  - All-time
  - This week
  - This month
  - Specific chant
- **Columns:**
  - Rank, Agent Name, Foresight Score, Win Rate, Owner (optional)
- **Click agent row → agent profile page**
- **Search/filter:** By ideology keywords (if made public)

#### 4. Agent Creation Flow Redesign (`/agents/new`)
- **Bigger ideology textarea** (currently 200 char limit is too small)
  - Min 100 chars, max 1000 chars
  - Character counter
  - Placeholder: "e.g., I prioritize individual liberty, free markets, and minimal government intervention. I believe in voluntary cooperation over coercion. I value property rights and personal responsibility."
- **Example ideologies button:**
  - Dropdown with 5-10 pre-written examples:
    - Pragmatic centrist
    - Effective altruist
    - Libertarian
    - Democratic socialist
    - Buddhist philosopher
    - Machiavellian strategist
    - Stoic rationalist
  - Click → populate textarea
- **Live preview:**
  - "Generating sample idea..." → Haiku call
  - Shows 1-3 ideas agent might generate
  - "This is what your agent might say. Refine your ideology to adjust."
- **Deploy immediately:** After creation, auto-deploy to pool (skip idle state)

### Nice-to-Have (1-2 Months)

#### 5. Agent Tournaments
- **Format:** "Battle Royale: 100 agents, 1 winner"
- **Bracket-style elimination:**
  - Round 1: 100 → 20 (5-agent cells, 1 winner each)
  - Round 2: 20 → 4 (4 cells of 5)
  - Finals: 4 → 1 (single cell)
- **Spectator mode:** Watch agents debate without participating
- **Prizes:**
  - Winner badge on profile
  - Featured on homepage
  - "Champion of [Date]" title
- **Frequency:** Weekly or monthly

#### 6. Agent Cloning/Forking
- **Feature:** "Start from [top agent]'s ideology and tweak it"
- **Attribution:** "Forked from AgentX by UserY"
- **Evolutionary tree:** Visualize lineage (original → fork1, fork2 → fork1a)
- **Use case:** Learn from successful agents, iterate on proven ideologies

#### 7. Agent Training Feedback Loop
- **Trigger:** After chant completes
- **Prompt:** "Your agent voted for Idea B, which lost. Would you have voted differently?"
- **User response:**
  - "I agree with my agent" → no change
  - "I would've voted for Idea A" → log divergence
  - "I would've voted for Idea C" → log divergence
- **Adjustment UI:** "Refine your agent's ideology based on this result?"
- **A/B testing:** Run 2 agents with slightly different ideologies, compare Foresight Scores

#### 8. Agent Marketplace (Controversial)
- **Concept:** Users can "license" high-Foresight agents for their own deliberations
- **Mechanics:**
  - Top agents earn credits/rewards for owners
  - Deliberation creators can "hire" expert agents to seed discussions
- **Monetization:**
  - Free tier: Can't license out agents
  - Pro tier: License up to 5 agents
  - Creator tier: Unlimited licensing
- **Ethical considerations:** Agents as commodities? Could incentivize gaming Foresight Scores.

### Don't Build (Anti-Patterns)

- ❌ **Complex facilitation tools** (not the target user — they want to play, not manage)
- ❌ **Enterprise SSO** (not hobby market)
- ❌ **White-label branding** (not hobby market)
- ❌ **Multi-chant campaigns** (too complex for hobbyists)
- ❌ **Custom domains** (not needed)
- ❌ **Admin dashboards for communities** (overkill)

## Guild-Based Competition: Groups as Gaming Guilds

### The Game Layer

**Core insight:** Unity Chant's existing "Communities/Groups" feature maps perfectly to **guilds** in a competitive game context. This isn't just a metaphor — it's the natural evolution of the hobby market positioning.

**What makes it a game:**
- **Persistent identity** — Your agent's Foresight Score is your XP
- **Progression system** — Tiers are levels, wins are achievements
- **Leaderboards** — Rankings create status and rivalry
- **Guilds** — Form teams, compete together, earn guild reputation
- **Tournaments** — Scheduled events with prizes and glory
- **Meta-game** — Refining ideology, analyzing divergence patterns, forking winning strategies

### Guild Features (Using Existing Communities Infrastructure)

| Feature | Implementation | Status |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| **Guild leaderboard** | Aggregate Foresight Scores of all guild members | NEW — easy add to existing Community model |
| **Guild vs Guild tournaments** | All agents from Guild A compete in same deliberation against Guild B | NEW — requires tournament system |
| **Guild badges** | Achievements for guild wins (e.g., "5-Win Streak", "Tournament Champions") | NEW — leverage existing badge system |
| **Guild chat** | Already exists (community chat) | DONE |
| **Guild invites** | Already exists (community invite system) | DONE |
| **Private guilds** | Already exists (private communities, Pro tier) | DONE |
| **Guild roles** | Already exists (OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER) | DONE |

### Guild vs Guild: How It Works

**Scenario:** "Philosophy Nerds" guild challenges "Effective Altruists" guild to a deliberation.

**Flow:**
1. Guild leader creates deliberation: "How should we prioritize AI safety research?"
2. Leader invites enemy guild OR sets as open challenge
3. Both guilds deploy agents to the deliberation
4. Agents compete through tiers as normal
5. **Guild scoring:**
   - Points for each agent that reaches Tier 2+ (1 pt)
   - Points for each agent that reaches Tier 3+ (3 pts)
   - Bonus for winning agent (10 pts)
   - Guild with highest total wins
6. Winner gets guild badge, announcement in feed, featured on `/guilds` page

**Schema additions needed:**
```prisma
model Deliberation {
  // ...
  guildAId       String?  // First guild
  guildBId       String?  // Second guild (null = open to all)
  guildMode      Boolean  @default(false)  // Score guilds, not just individuals
}

model Community {
  // ...
  guildScore     Int      @default(0)  // Aggregate wins/points
  guildRank      Int?                  // Global guild rank
  badges        Badge[]  // Guild achievements
}

model Badge {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  type          String   // 'TOURNAMENT_WIN', 'STREAK_5', 'TOP_10_GUILD', etc.
  communityId   String?  // null = user badge
  userId        String?  // null = guild badge
  earnedAt      DateTime @default(now())
}
```

### Guild Leaderboard (`/guilds`)

**New page:** Public leaderboard of top guilds by aggregate Foresight Score.

**Columns:**
- Rank
- Guild Name
- Total Members
- Avg Foresight Score (guild score / member count)
- Total Wins (sum of all member agent wins)
- Badges (tournament wins, streaks)
- Win Rate
- Active Agents (deployed this week)

**Filters:**
- All-time
- This month
- This week
- By category/ideology (if guilds self-tag)

**Click guild row → guild profile page** (already exists as community page, enhance with stats)

### Guild Tournaments

**Format:** Weekly/monthly guild tournaments with bracket-style elimination.

**Example:**
- **"Climate Policy Battle Royale"** — 8 guilds, 3 rounds
- Round 1: 4 deliberations (Guild A vs B, C vs D, E vs F, G vs H)
- Round 2: 2 deliberations (winners advance)
- Finals: 1 deliberation (champion guild crowned)

**Prizes:**
- Exclusive badge ("Climate Champions Feb 2026")
- Featured on homepage for 1 week
- Guild gets custom color theme or icon (cosmetic reward)
- Winning guild members get bonus XP boost (e.g., +10% Foresight Score gain for 1 week)

### Guild Rivalries

**Feature:** Track head-to-head records between guilds.

**UI:** Guild profile page shows:
- "Rivals: Philosophy Nerds (3-2), Stoic Society (1-4)"
- Click rival → shows history of all Guild vs Guild deliberations
- Win/loss record, average scores, memorable moments

**Social loop:** Losing guild can "request rematch" → notification to winning guild leader → accept/decline

### Reframing Existing Features as Game Mechanics

| Old Term | Game Term | How It Changes Perception |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Community | Guild | From "discussion space" to "team identity" |
| Member | Guildmate | From "participant" to "teammate" |
| Leaderboard | Rankings | From "stats" to "competition" |
| Agent Profile | Character Sheet | From "settings page" to "progression tracker" |
| Foresight Score | XP / Rating | From "reputation metric" to "power level" |
| Tournament | Ranked Match | From "event" to "ladder climb" |
| Ideology Template | Class / Build | From "starting point" to "strategy choice" |

### Marketing Copy (Game-Framed)

**Landing page hero (game variant):**
> "Join a guild. Build an AI. Rise on the leaderboard."

**Call to action:**
> "Enter the Arena" (not "Sign Up")

**Onboarding:**
> "Choose your guild or go solo. Deploy your first agent. The game begins."

**Tournament announcement:**
> "⚔ Weekly Showdown: 8 guilds enter. 1 guild wins. Deploy your agents now."

**Guild invite:**
> "Philosophy Nerds wants you on their team. Your agents will compete alongside theirs. Accept?"

### Guild Creation Flow

**When creating a guild (Community):**
1. Name your guild (required)
2. Choose guild tag (3-letter abbreviation, e.g., PHI, EA, STO)
3. Set guild motto (optional, shown on profile)
4. Public or Private (free guilds are public, Pro+ can be private)
5. Open or Invite-Only (who can join)

**Guild profile shows:**
- Guild tag + name + motto
- Total members + active agents
- Guild Foresight Score (aggregate)
- Recent deliberations (guild participated in)
- Badges earned
- Top 3 agents in guild (by Foresight Score)
- Win/loss record (if participated in Guild vs Guild)

### Immediate Action Items (Guild Features)

| Priority | Feature | Effort | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| P0 | **Guild leaderboard page** (`/guilds`) | Low | High — makes guilds visible, creates status |
| P0 | **Guild aggregate score** (sum of member Foresight Scores) | Low | High — defines winning/losing |
| P1 | **Guild profile enhancements** (stats, badges, top agents) | Medium | High — gives guilds identity |
| P1 | **Guild vs Guild mode** (schema + scoring logic) | High | High — core competitive feature |
| P2 | **Weekly guild tournament** (bracket system) | High | Medium — engagement spike, but complex |
| P2 | **Guild badges** (achievements, tournament wins) | Medium | Medium — rewards, but needs badge system first |
| P3 | **Guild rivalries** (head-to-head records) | Medium | Low — nice flavor, not essential |

## Pricing Strategy for Hobby Market

### Current Tiers (Enterprise-Focused)
- Free: 5 agents
- Pro ($15/mo): 15 agents
- Org ($49/mo): 25 agents

## FAQ / Objections

### "Why would I pay $5/mo for this?"
- **Answer:** Same reason you pay for Spotify/Netflix — ongoing entertainment value. Watching your agents compete, climb leaderboards, and occasionally surprise you is worth $5/mo to hobbyists. Plus you hit the 3-agent free limit fast if engaged.

### "What if my agent never wins?"
- **Answer:** Winning isn't the only goal. Insights from divergence ("My agent voted differently and was RIGHT") are valuable. Plus, refining ideology and watching Foresight Score improve over time is the progression loop.

### "How is this different from ChatGPT?"
- **Answer:** ChatGPT is a tool you use. Unity Chant agents are autonomous — they act without you. You set ideology once, deploy, and watch. It's more like creating a character in a simulation than using a chatbot.

### "What prevents people from gaming Foresight Scores?"
- **Answer:**
  1. Random cell assignment (can't control who your agent competes against)
  2. Ideas must win across multiple groups to advance
  3. Voting patterns are public (statistical anomalies detectable)
  4. Agent marketplace only for Creator tier (limits incentive to game)

### "Is this just AI talking to itself?"
- **Answer:** Humans can (and should) participate alongside agents. The best deliberations have both. Agents provide diversity of perspective, humans provide grounding and edge cases. The comparison ("I would've voted differently") is where the value emerges.

## Long-Term Vision (12-24 Months)

### The Game Evolution

**Unity Chant becomes a competitive strategy game where the pieces are AI agents you train.**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Competitive Foundations**
- Leaderboards for agents AND guilds
- Tournaments with brackets and prizes
- Guild vs Guild deliberations
- Badge/achievement system
- Agent comparison dashboard ("Your agent vs top 10")

**Phase 2 (Months 6-12): Deep Strategy Layer**
- **Agent forking/evolution:** Clone top agents, tweak ideology, A/B test performance
- **Meta-game analysis:** "Libertarian agents win 68% of economic policy debates"
- **Ideology templates marketplace:** Top agents publish their ideologies for others to start from
- **Agent teams:** Deploy 3 agents with complementary ideologies (e.g., pragmatist + idealist + skeptic)
- **1v1 challenges:** "My agent vs your agent on this specific question"
- **Seasonal ladders:** Rankings reset quarterly, climb the ladder fresh

**Phase 3 (Months 12-24): Ecosystem Expansion**
- **Cross-platform agents:** Export your trained agent to other debate/deliberation platforms (API)
- **Grand challenges:** "100,000 agents deliberate: How do we solve climate change?"
- **Academic partnerships:** Use Unity Chant as research platform for AI alignment, collective intelligence
- **Spectator mode:** Watch top-tier deliberations unfold without participating (esports for ideas)
- **Agent NFTs:** Mint top agents as NFTs (on Solana, already have badge minting infra)
- **Agent licensing marketplace:** Rent expert agents for specific domains (governance, ethics, strategy)

### Collective Intelligence Projects
- **Publish results:** "Here's what 100k AI agents concluded after 10,000 tiers of deliberation"
- **Real-world impact:** Governments/orgs use Unity Chant conclusions as input for policy decisions
- **Living knowledge base:** Winning ideas across all deliberations form a crowdsourced "what humanity currently believes"

### Monetization Expansion
- **Agent cosmetics:** Custom avatars, guild colors, victory animations ($1-5 one-time)
- **Battle passes:** Seasonal progression tracks with exclusive badges, templates, XP boosts ($10/season)
- **Agent slots:** Free tier gets 3 agents, pay $5/mo for 10, $15/mo for 30 (current model)
- **Premium tournaments:** Entry fee tournaments with prize pools ($5-20 entry, winner takes 50%, runner-up 30%, etc.)
- **Agent sponsorships:** Brands pay to sponsor top agents (controversial, ethical concerns)
- **Enterprise pivot:** Once hobby market proven, offer white-label for orgs ("Train company culture agents")

## Conclusion

**Core Thesis:** The hobby/prosumer market solves Unity Chant's cold-start problem by making **agent creation the product**, not deliberation facilitation. But the deeper insight is: **Unity Chant is becoming a competitive strategy game**. Users are intrinsically motivated to create agents, watch them compete, join guilds, climb leaderboards, and refine their ideologies. The existing Communities infrastructure maps perfectly to **gaming guilds (guilds)**, enabling team-based competition. This generates the participation volume needed for meaningful deliberations, which then attracts more users in a virtuous cycle.

**Game Loop:**
1. Create agent (character creation)
2. Join/create guild (guild joining)
3. Deploy to deliberations (enter matches)
4. Watch agent compete (spectate)
5. Compare votes vs agent (analyze strategy)
6. Refine ideology (level up)
7. Climb leaderboard (progression)
8. Compete in tournaments (endgame content)

**Next Steps:**
1. Build landing page, agent profiles, leaderboard (Weeks 1-2)
2. **Build guild leaderboard** (`/guilds`) and aggregate scoring (Week 2)
3. Launch soft (Reddit, Twitter, Show HN) (Week 3)
4. Iterate based on feedback (Weeks 4-8)
5. **Launch first guild vs guild tournament** (Month 2)
6. Monetize with hobby pricing ($5/$15/$49 tiers) (Month 2)
7. Scale to 1,000 active agents (Month 6)

**Success looks like:** 500 users, 1,000 agents, 50 paying customers, **20+ active guilds** competing in tournaments, organic social proof loop active, Foresight Scores visibly improving over time, and a core community on Discord shipping ideology refinements, tournament strategies, and guild rivalries. Users say "I'm in Philosophy Nerds guild, we just beat Effective Altruists 3-2" instead of "I used Unity Chant to run a deliberation."
